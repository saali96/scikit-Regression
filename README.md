# scikit Regression

This repository contains a comparative analysis of different regression algorithms using scikit-learn. The algorithms tested include linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression. The program performs preprocessing on the data, including imputing null values, checking for null and duplicate values, normalizing the data, and splitting into train and test sets and denormalizing after predicting the y values. The program then trains and compares the models using various evaluation metrics, including the R2 score as accuracy, mean absolute error and mean square error. The program is designed to provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and to help determine the best algorithm for a given regression task.
